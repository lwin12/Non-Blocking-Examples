# Non-Blocking-Examples
To demonstrate the usage of millis(). 

When starting off microcontroller programming, we tend to rely on the delay function. However, as your program gets more and more complex, in cases where your microcontroller have to always listen for an input and perform other functions at the same time, you will start to notice that delay will cause a lot of issue.

This example will demonstrate the useage of millis() function to be able to make a program that is fully non blocking.
